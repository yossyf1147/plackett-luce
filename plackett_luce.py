'''
Calculates the Bradley Terry factors for bots from Halite using Plackett-Luce model,
which is the generalization of BT for multiplayer rankings.  This model is more
appropriate for static competitiors (like programmed bots) than TrueSkill rankings,
because it gives equal weight to the whole history at once and is not order-dependent.
As result, proper orderings can be determined with less data.

         Hunter, David R. MM algorithms for generalized Bradley-Terry models.
            Ann. Statist. 32 (2004), no. 1, 384--406. doi:10.1214/aos/1079120141.

The algorithm here generates the BT factors using MLE.  A Bayesian approach has
also recently been developed, which has some advantages.  See "Bayesian inference for
Plackett-Luce ranking models"  (Guiver, Snelson; 2009).
